# Laboratory Website – SACC Lab @ NYCU

[Lab Website](https://shih.lab.nycu.edu.tw/)

## Overview
This is an undergraduate web development project for **Shih's Lab** at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)**.  
The goal is to build a modern, responsive, and maintainable lab website to showcase research, members, publications, and courses.

The site is built using **Next.js** (a React framework) and hosted on a **self-managed server** within the university network.  
A custom **DNS subdomain was requested through the university IT department**, enabling public access via `shih.lab.nycu.edu.tw`.

The production server is managed with **PM2**, providing process monitoring and automatic restarts for improved stability and uptime.
